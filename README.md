# Job Portal Microservices Application

## Overview
The **Job Portal Application** is a microservices-based backend system designed for managing jobs, reviews, and companies. It follows a **distributed architecture** using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Cloud**, and **PostgreSQL**, with services containerized using **Docker**. The system is equipped with an **API Gateway**, **Eureka Server**, and **Spring Boot Actuator** for monitoring and scalability.

## Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: Independent Job, Review, and Company services.
- **Spring Cloud Integration**: Eureka for service discovery and API Gateway for routing.
- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL as the primary database.
- **Containerization**: Dockerized for seamless deployment.
- **Monitoring**: Integrated Spring Boot Actuator.
- **Scalability**: Loosely coupled services for better performance and flexibility.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Service Discovery**: Eureka Server
- **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Monitoring**: Spring Boot Actuator
